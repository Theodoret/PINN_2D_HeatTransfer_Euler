# PINN_2D_HeatTransfer_Euler

A MATLAB (R2021b) program for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in a heat transfer case on a two-dimensional square field. In this program, PINNs were used to solve space discretization, while Euler's implicit method was used to integrate the time. Later on, the accuracy is compared with the Finite Difference Method, i.e., a common numerical method to solve space discritization, and the exact solution [1].
